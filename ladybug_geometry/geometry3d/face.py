class Face3D(Base2DIn3D):
    """Planar Face in 3D space.

    Args:
        boundary: A list or tuple of Point3D objects representing the outer
            boundary vertices of the face.
        plane: A Plane object indicating the plane in which the face exists.
            If None, the Plane normal will automatically be calculated by
            analyzing the input vertices and the origin of the plane will be
            the first vertex of the input vertices. Default: None.
        holes: Optional list of lists with one list for each hole in the face.
            Each hole should be a list of at least 3 Point3D objects.
            If None, it will be assumed that there are no holes in the face.
            The boundary and holes are stored as separate lists of Point3Ds on the
            `boundary` and `holes` properties of this object. However, the
            `vertices` property will always contain all vertices across the shape.
            For a Face3D that has holes, it will trace out a single shape that
            turns inwards from the boundary to cut out the holes.
        enforce_right_hand: Boolean to note whether a check should be run to
            ensure that input vertices are counterclockwise within the input plane,
            thereby enforcing the right-hand rule. By default, this is True
            and ensures that all Face3D objects adhere to the right-hand rule.
            It is recommended that this only be set to False in cases where you
            are certain that the input vertices are counter-clockwise
            within the input plane and you would like to avoid the extra
            unnecessary check.

        the ladybug_geometry objects are not used in order to remove assertions
        and increase speed.
