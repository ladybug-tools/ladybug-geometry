    """Object with Multiple Planar Faces in 3D Space. Includes solid objects and polyhedra.

    Args:
        vertices: A list of Point3D objects representing the vertices of
            this PolyFace.
        face_indices: A list of lists with one list for each face of the polyface.
            Each face list must contain at least one tuple of integers corresponding
            to indices within the vertices list. Additional tuples of integers may
            follow this one such that the first tuple denotes the boundary of the
            face while each subsequent tuple denotes a hole in the face.
        edge_information: Optional edge information, which will speed up the
            creation of the Polyface object if it is available but should be left
            as None if it is unknown. If None, edge_information will be computed
            from the vertices and face_indices inputs. Edge information
            should be formatted as a dictionary with two keys as follows:

            *   'edge_indices':
                An array objects that each contain two integers.
                These integers correspond to indices within the vertices list and
                each tuple represents a line segment for an edge of the polyface.
            *   'edge_types':
                An array of integers for each edge that parallels the edge_indices
                list. An integer of 0 denotes a naked edge, an integer of 1
                denotes an internal edge. Anything higher is a non-manifold edge.
