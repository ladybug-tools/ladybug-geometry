"""A 2D Directed Graph Network data structure used for splitting polygons.

A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph made up of a set of vertices (aka. nodes)
connected by directed edges, often into a network where each node can have
multiple connections.

This class is used in all operations where a polygon or face is split using
line segments or polylines.

The overall strategies used in this module are inspired by operations performed by
NetworkX but were constructed from scratch without working from any particular
module or class in the package More information on NetworkX can be found here:
